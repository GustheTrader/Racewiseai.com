      comment: "Gold Search is ideally positioned for a stalk-and-pounce trip. Foley works of note, he looks tough to endorse, has a good record of 18% with horses dropping in class, and this colt's top-ranked FIRE and Fast Fig make him a solid threat."
    },
    {
      name: "Rivalry",
      comment: "Rivalry cuts back to a sprint for the third start off the layoff. He's previously faced much tougher, and today's lower level combined with a sharp early pace figures positions him as a serious late threat."
    },
    {
      name: "Beer With Ice",
      comment: "Son of A Giant figures to lead early but couldn't outfinish softer at Turfway. Recent upward class moves have not helped his cause, and despite decent early speed figures, he looks vulnerable late."
    },
    {
      name: "Quebrancho",
      comment: "Quebrancho is questionable at this distance, having never recently contested a similar sprint. Trainer Bahena's stable's decent recent results but his horse needs considerable improvement."
    },
    {
      name: "Dancing Noah",
      comment: "Dancing Noah has limited sprint experience and no meaningful recent trainer stats. His efforts have been mediocre, and improvement would be needed."
    },
    {
      name: "More Than Five",
      comment: "More Than Five boasts decent recent performances against tougher and has strong figures to back him. Garcia's respectable dirt figures further strengthens his case as a solid contender."
